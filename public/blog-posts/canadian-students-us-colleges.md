## Common Mistakes Canadian Students Make

"I'm from Canada, my education is strong" - US universities still require standardized tests. Aim for 1450+.

### 3. Poor Essay Quality
Generic essays don't work. Tell your unique Canadian story and show genuine interest in each university.

### 4. Missing Deadlines
US application deadlines are strict. Canadian universities have rolling admissions; US universities don't.

### 5. Not Applying for Financial Aid
Many Canadians assume they can't get aid. Apply to need-blind schools for full coverage!

### 6. Applying to Too Few Schools
Apply to 8-12 universities (mix of reach, target, safety) to maximize admission and aid offers.
