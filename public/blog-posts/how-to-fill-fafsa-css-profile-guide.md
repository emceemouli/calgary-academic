Filling out financial aid forms can feel overwhelming. Between the FAFSA and CSS Profile, you're looking at dozens of questions about income, assets, taxes, and family finances. One mistake could cost you thousands of dollars in financial aid.

But here's the good news: with the right preparation and step-by-step guidance, you can complete these forms accurately and maximize your aid eligibility.

This comprehensive guide walks you through both the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and CSS Profile, explaining exactly what you need, when to file, and how to avoid the costly mistakes that trip up thousands of families every year.

Whether you're a US student applying for federal aid, an international student navigating the CSS Profile, or a parent trying to help your child through the process, this guide has you covered.

## Understanding FAFSA vs CSS Profile: Which Do You Need?

Before diving into the applications, let's clarify which forms you actually need to complete.

### What Is FAFSA?

The **FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)** is the application for federal student aid in the United States. It's used to determine your eligibility for:

**Federal Pell Grants** (up to $7,395 for 2024-25, doesn't need to be repaid)

**Federal student loans** (subsidized and unsubsidized)

**Federal Work-Study** programs

**State financial aid** in many states

**Institutional aid** at many colleges and universities

### Who Must File FAFSA?

**US citizens** applying to US colleges must file FAFSA to receive federal aid.

**Permanent residents** (green card holders) are also eligible for federal aid through FAFSA.

**Some non-citizens** with specific immigration statuses may qualify (refugees, asylum seekers, certain visa holders).

**International students** (F-1 visa, no green card) are **NOT eligible** for federal aid and don't complete FAFSA.

### What Is CSS Profile?

The **CSS Profile** is administered by the College Board and is used by about 400 colleges and universities (mostly private schools) to award their own institutional financial aid.

The CSS Profile asks much more detailed questions about your family's finances than FAFSA. It digs deeper into assets, home equity, small business ownership, and other financial details.

### Who Must File CSS Profile?

You need CSS Profile if:

Your college requires it (check each school's financial aid website)

You're applying for **institutional grants and scholarships** at participating schools

You're an **international student** applying for aid at schools that require CSS Profile

**Note:** Many elite private universities require CSS Profile in addition to FAFSA for US students, or CSS Profile only for international students.

### Can You File Both?

Yes! Many US students file **both FAFSA and CSS Profile**:

**FAFSA** for federal aid eligibility

**CSS Profile** for additional institutional aid at schools that require it

Check each college's requirements carefully. Some schools only need FAFSA, others only CSS Profile, and many require both.

## FAFSA 2025-26: Complete Step-by-Step Guide

Let's walk through the FAFSA application from start to finish.

### Before You Begin: Documents You'll Need

Gather these documents before starting your FAFSA application:

**Social Security Number** (for student and parents if applicable)

**Driver's license** (if you have one)

**2023 Federal Tax Returns** (yours and your parents' if you're a dependent student)

**W-2 forms** from 2023

**Records of untaxed income** (child support, veterans benefits, etc.)

**Current bank statements**

**Investment records** (stocks, bonds, real estate other than your home)

**Business records** if you or your parents own a business

**Note:** The 2025-26 FAFSA uses 2023 tax information (two years prior). This is called "prior-prior year" data.

### Step 1: Create Your FSA ID

Before filling out FAFSA, you need an **FSA ID** (Federal Student Aid ID). This serves as your legal electronic signature.

**How to Create an FSA ID:**

1. Go to fsaid.ed.gov
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Enter your Social Security Number, name, and date of birth (must match Social Security records exactly)
4. Create a username and password
5. Enter contact information and security questions
6. Verify your email and mobile number

**Important:** If you're a dependent student, your parent also needs to create their own FSA ID. Use different email addresses for student and parent FSA IDs.

**Save your FSA ID information securely.** You'll use it throughout college and for student loan management after graduation.

### Step 2: Start Your FAFSA Application

**Go to studentaid.gov** and click "Start Here" under FAFSA.

Log in with your FSA ID.

The application will ask if you're filling it out for yourself (student) or helping someone else (parent filling out for student).

### Step 3: Student Demographics

The first section asks basic questions about you:

**Name** (must match Social Security card exactly)

**Date of birth**

**Social Security Number**

**Phone number and email** (use ones you check regularly)

**Permanent mailing address**

**Citizenship status**

**State of legal residence**

**Date you became a legal resident** of your state

**Selective Service registration** (required for males born after 12/31/1959)

**Answer these questions carefully.** Incorrect information can delay your aid or even disqualify you.

### Step 4: School Selection

List the colleges you're applying to or attending. You can list up to **20 schools** on FAFSA.

**Important tips:**

List schools in **any order** - the order doesn't matter for federal aid (though some states prioritize the first school listed for state aid)

Use the **federal school code** for each institution (search in the FAFSA form)

You can **add or remove schools** later by updating your FAFSA

Include all schools you're **seriously considering**, even if you haven't decided yet

Your FAFSA information will be sent to all schools you list. They'll use it to create financial aid packages.

### Step 5: Dependency Status

FAFSA determines if you're **dependent** or **independent**. This affects whose financial information you must report.

**You're considered independent if you answer YES to any of these:**

Are you 24 years old or older?

Are you married?

Are you working toward a master's or doctoral degree?

Do you have children who receive more than half their support from you?

Do you have dependents (other than children or spouse) who live with you and receive more than half their support from you?

Are you currently serving on active duty in the US Armed Forces?

Are you a veteran of the US Armed Forces?

Are both your parents deceased, or are you (or were you until age 18) a ward of the court or in foster care?

Are you an emancipated minor or in legal guardianship?

Are you an unaccompanied youth who is homeless or at risk of being homeless?

**If you answer NO to all of these, you're a dependent student** and must provide parent information.

### Step 6: Student Financial Information

This section asks about your income and assets.

**Income Questions:**

Did you file a **2023 tax return**? (Yes/No/Will file)

If yes, the FAFSA will attempt to retrieve your tax information using the **IRS Data Retrieval Tool** (highly recommended - this prevents errors and speeds up processing)

If you haven't filed yet, estimate and update later

**2023 income from work** (wages, salaries, tips - from W-2)

**Additional financial information:**
- Untaxed income (child support received, veterans benefits, etc.)
- Money earned through work-study or need-based employment
- Combat pay or special combat pay
- Cooperative education program earnings

**Asset Questions:**

Cash, savings, and checking account balances **as of the date you file** FAFSA

Investment net worth (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate other than your home)
- Don't include your primary residence
- Don't include retirement accounts (401k, IRA, pension)
- Don't include the value of life insurance or annuities

Business net worth (if you own more than 50% of a business with 100+ employees)

**Common student mistakes:**

Including **parent-owned** assets (like college savings in parent's name) in the student section

Reporting **retirement accounts** (these aren't counted on FAFSA)

Reporting the **family home** (your primary residence isn't counted)

### Step 7: Parent Financial Information (Dependent Students)

If you're a dependent student, you'll provide detailed information about your parents' finances.

**Which parent's information to report:**

If your parents are **married or living together**: Report both parents' information

If your parents are **divorced or separated**: Report the parent you lived with most during the past 12 months
- If equal time with both, report the parent who provided more financial support
- Include stepparent information if the custodial parent has remarried

If your parents are **unmarried and living together**: Report both parents' information

**Parent Income:**

Use the **IRS Data Retrieval Tool** to import 2023 tax information directly (strongly recommended)

If unable to use the tool, manually enter:
- Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from tax return
- Income taxes paid
- Untaxed income (IRA contributions, child support received, etc.)

**Parent Assets:**

Cash, savings, and checking account balances as of the date you file

Investments (stocks, bonds, real estate other than primary home)

Business net worth (if applicable)

**What NOT to report:**

Your family's primary home value

Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, pension plans)

Life insurance cash value

Annuities

Small family farms that you live on and operate

Small businesses with fewer than 100 employees (if you own more than 50%)

### Step 8: Review and Sign

Carefully review all information before submitting.

**Common errors to check:**

Social Security Numbers entered correctly

Names match Social Security cards exactly

Income and tax figures match 2023 tax returns

Asset values are as of the date you're filing (not from tax returns)

All required questions answered

**Sign electronically** using your FSA ID.

If you're a dependent student, your parent must also sign using their FSA ID.

### Step 9: Submit and Get Your SAR

After submitting, you'll receive a **Student Aid Report (SAR)** within 3-5 days if you provided an email address.

The SAR shows:

Your **Expected Family Contribution (EFC)** or **Student Aid Index (SAI)** - this is what your family is expected to contribute

All the information you submitted

Any errors or issues that need correction

**Review your SAR carefully** and make corrections if needed. You can update your FAFSA online using your FSA ID.

### FAFSA Deadlines

**Federal deadline:** June 30, 2026 for the 2025-26 academic year

**State deadlines:** Vary by state, often much earlier (some as early as March 2025)

**College deadlines:** Vary by institution, typically align with admission deadlines

**Best practice:** File as soon as possible after October 1, 2024 (when the 2025-26 FAFSA opens). Some aid is awarded first-come, first-served.

> **Plan Your Applications:** Use our [GPA Calculator](/gpa-calculator) to understand how your grades might affect merit aid eligibility at different schools.

## CSS Profile: Complete Step-by-Step Guide

The CSS Profile is more detailed than FAFSA and asks deeper questions about your family's finances.

### Before You Begin: Documents You'll Need

The CSS Profile requires similar documents to FAFSA, plus additional information:

**Everything needed for FAFSA** (see above)

**Home value and mortgage information** (CSS Profile counts home equity)

**Detailed business information** (more extensive than FAFSA)

**Detailed farm information** if applicable

**Medical and dental expenses** not covered by insurance

**Elementary/high school tuition** for siblings

**Parent information** for non-custodial parent (if required by school)

**International tax documents** for international students (tax returns from home country, translated to English)

### Step 1: Create a College Board Account

Go to **cssprofile.collegeboard.org** and create an account.

Use the same email address you used for your SAT (if you took it) to link accounts.

If you already have a College Board account for SAT, use that login.

### Step 2: Start Your CSS Profile

Click "Apply for Aid" and select the academic year you're applying for.

The CSS Profile costs **$25 for the first school** and **$16 for each additional school**.

**Fee waivers are automatically granted** to students from families:
- With income up to $100,000 for a family of four (adjusted for family size)
- Who received an SAT fee waiver
- Who are orphans or wards of the court under age 24

If you qualify, you can send your CSS Profile to up to 20 schools for free.

### Step 3: Student Information

Similar to FAFSA, you'll provide:

**Personal information** (name, date of birth, Social Security Number if you have one)

**Contact information**

**Citizenship status**

**Living arrangements** (who you live with, custody arrangements if parents are divorced)

**Current grade level** and high school information

The CSS Profile asks **more detailed questions** about special circumstances:
- Are you or your siblings attending private elementary/high school?
- Do you have unusual medical expenses?
- Has there been a recent change in your family's income?

### Step 4: Family Information

**Parents' marital status:**

The CSS Profile asks for more detail than FAFSA:
- When did your parents marry/divorce/separate?
- If divorced, what are the custody arrangements?
- Does your non-custodial parent contribute to your support?

**Household size:**

List everyone in your household:
- Parents
- Siblings
- Other relatives supported by your parents

For each person, indicate if they'll be in college during the upcoming year (this affects your aid eligibility).

### Step 5: Schools Selection

List all schools you want to receive your CSS Profile.

**Check each school's specific requirements:**
- Some schools require additional CSS Profile questions
- Some require non-custodial parent CSS Profile
- Deadlines vary by school

You can add schools later, but you'll pay the fee for each school added after initial submission.

### Step 6: Student's Income and Benefits

**Student income from work:**

Report your 2023 income from W-2s, 1099s, and other sources

If you worked, report total earnings

**Student benefits:**

Untaxed income (child support, veterans benefits, etc.)

Benefits received on your behalf

**Student's expected summer/school year earnings:**

The CSS Profile asks you to estimate how much you expect to earn:
- During summer 2025
- During the 2025-26 academic year

Be realistic. Schools use this to gauge your contribution to college costs.

### Step 7: Student's Assets and Resources

**More detailed than FAFSA:**

**Cash, savings, and checking** (as of the date you file)

**Trust accounts** in your name

**UGMA/UTMA accounts** (custodial accounts)

**529 college savings plans** owned by you

**Investment accounts** (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)

**Real estate** you own (other than primary residence - yes, CSS Profile asks students about this)

**Business ownership** if applicable

**Resources available for college:**

Money from relatives who will help pay for college

**Scholarships you've already received**

**Educational loan information** (if you're planning to borrow)

### Step 8: Parents' Income

**2023 income (from tax returns):**

The CSS Profile **does not have an IRS Data Retrieval Tool** like FAFSA. You must enter information manually from your tax returns.

**Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**

**Income taxes paid** (federal, state, local)

**Itemized or standard deduction** used

**Income from work** for each parent separately

**Untaxed income and benefits:**

Contributions to retirement accounts (401k, IRA, etc.)

Child support received

Housing, food, and other living allowances (military, clergy, etc.)

Veterans benefits

**Other income:**

Business income or loss

Rental income

Farm income

**The CSS Profile asks about previous year too:**

You'll provide **2022 income information** as well as 2023. This helps schools see income trends.

**Current year income estimates:**

Estimate your parents' **2024 income** - schools use this to understand if your family's financial situation is improving or declining.

### Step 9: Parents' Assets

This is where CSS Profile gets **significantly more detailed than FAFSA**.

**Cash and bank accounts** (checking, savings)

**Investment accounts:**
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Real estate other than primary home
- Trust funds
- Precious metals

**Home equity:**

**Current market value** of your primary residence

**Amount owed** on mortgages and home equity loans

**Purchase price** and year purchased

Some schools cap home equity consideration at 1.2x, 2x, or 3x income. Others count it fully.

**Business and farm assets:**

Much more detail than FAFSA:
- Total value of business/farm
- Debt against business/farm
- Number of employees
- Percentage ownership

**Retirement accounts:**

Unlike FAFSA, CSS Profile **asks for retirement account balances** though most schools don't count them in aid calculations.

**Other assets:**

Trust fund values

Cash value of life insurance

Money owed to you (loans you made to others)

### Step 10: Parents' Expenses

This is **unique to CSS Profile** - FAFSA doesn't ask about expenses.

**Medical and dental expenses:**

Out-of-pocket costs not covered by insurance from 2023 and estimated for 2024

**Elementary/high school tuition:**

Private school tuition for siblings

**Other expenses:**

Dependent care (daycare, eldercare)

Unusual circumstances affecting finances

### Step 11: Special Circumstances

CSS Profile allows you to explain **special financial circumstances:**

**Job loss or income reduction**

**Unusual medical expenses**

**Divorce or separation** (especially recent)

**Death of a parent** or family member

**Care for elderly relatives**

**Natural disaster** affecting your home or business

**Extensive debt** from unusual circumstances

**Be specific and detailed.** This is your opportunity to explain why your family's financial situation on paper doesn't tell the whole story.

### Step 12: Supplemental Questions

Many schools add their own questions to the CSS Profile:

**School-specific questions** about assets, income, or circumstances

**Non-custodial parent information** (some schools require this)

**Business/farm supplements** for families with businesses or farms

You'll see which schools require supplemental questions when you add them to your list.

### Step 13: Review and Submit

**Carefully review all sections** before submitting.

**Common CSS Profile mistakes:**

Forgetting to include **home equity value**

Not reporting **retirement account balances** (even though asked)

Failing to explain **special circumstances** in detail

Using **estimates instead of actual figures** from tax returns

Not completing **school-specific supplemental sections**

**Submit the CSS Profile.**

You'll receive a confirmation email immediately.

Schools will receive your information, but unlike FAFSA, you **won't get a summary report** of what you submitted.

**Important:** Print or save a copy of your submission for your records.

### CSS Profile Deadlines

**Deadlines vary by school** - each college sets its own CSS Profile deadline.

**Early Action/Early Decision applicants:** Often have deadlines in November

**Regular Decision applicants:** Deadlines typically in January or February

**Some schools have priority deadlines** (submit by this date for best aid consideration) and regular deadlines

**Check each school's financial aid website** for specific deadlines.

**Best practice:** Submit CSS Profile at the same time you submit your admission application.

## For International Students: CSS Profile Special Considerations

If you're an international student applying for financial aid at US universities, here's what you need to know.

### International Students and FAFSA

**International students (F-1 visa, no green card) are NOT eligible for federal aid** and should not complete FAFSA.

Exceptions: Permanent residents (green card holders), refugees, asylum seekers, and certain other immigration statuses are eligible for FAFSA.

### International Students and CSS Profile

Many US universities require **international students to complete CSS Profile** to be considered for institutional financial aid.

**Additional requirements for international students:**

**Tax documents from your home country:**
- Income tax returns from your parents
- Official translations to English (certified translations)
- Currency conversion to US dollars

**ISFAA (International Student Financial Aid Application):**
- Some schools require this instead of or in addition to CSS Profile
- Check each school's requirements

**Certification of Finances:**
- Some schools require this to verify you can pay any costs not covered by aid
- Required for F-1 visa processing after admission

**Bank statements:**
- Showing current balances
- May need to show funds have been available for a specific period (3-6 months)

### Converting International Finances to USD

When completing CSS Profile as an international student:

**Use current exchange rates** (document which rate you used and the date)

**Convert annual income** from your home currency to US dollars

**Convert asset values** to US dollars

**Explain context:**
- Cost of living in your country
- Salary norms
- Any government subsidies or benefits

**Example:** If your father earns ₹3,000,000 annually in India and the exchange rate is ₹83/$1:
- $3,000,000 ÷ 83 = approximately $36,145 USD

### Special Circumstances for International Students

Use the special circumstances section to explain:

**Exchange rate impacts:** If your currency has weakened significantly, explain how this affects your family's purchasing power

**Employment limitations:** Explain if a parent's profession is government-regulated with fixed salaries

**Extended family obligations:** If supporting elderly parents or siblings is cultural norm

**Lack of social safety net:** If your country doesn't provide retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, or free healthcare

> **International Students:** Our [Elite ChanceMe Calculator](/elite-chance-me) can help you identify which schools offer the best financial aid to international applicants.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid on Both Forms

These errors cost families thousands in financial aid every year.

### Income and Asset Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Reporting retirement accounts as assets on FAFSA**

Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, pension) are **NOT counted on FAFSA**.

Only report: cash, checking/savings, investments, real estate (not primary home), business/farm value.

**Mistake 2: Reporting home value on FAFSA**

Your **primary residence is NOT counted** on FAFSA.

CSS Profile does ask for home value - don't confuse the two forms.

**Mistake 3: Using wrong year's income**

2025-26 FAFSA uses **2023 tax returns** (prior-prior year).

Using 2024 or current year income is incorrect.

**Mistake 4: Reporting assets as of tax filing date**

Assets should be reported **as of the date you file FAFSA/CSS Profile**, not December 31 or tax filing date.

**Mistake 5: Including money in parent-owned 529 plans as student assets**

529 plans owned by parents are **parent assets** (lower impact on aid).

529 plans owned by student are **student assets** (higher impact on aid).

### Dependency Status Mistakes

**Mistake 6: Incorrectly claiming independent status**

Just because you:
- Live on your own
- Pay your own bills
- File your own taxes
- Are not claimed on parents' taxes

Does **NOT make you independent** for FAFSA.

Review the dependency questions carefully. Most traditional undergraduate students are dependent.

**Mistake 7: Not including stepparent income**

If your custodial parent has remarried, you **must include stepparent information**, even if the stepparent doesn't contribute to your college costs.

### Reporting Mistakes

**Mistake 8: Not using IRS Data Retrieval Tool (FAFSA)**

Using the IRS DRT:
- Prevents errors
- Speeds up processing
- Reduces verification likelihood

Manually entering tax information increases error risk.

**Mistake 9: Leaving questions blank**

Never leave questions blank. If the answer is zero or not applicable, enter "0" or select "N/A."

Blank answers can cause processing delays or rejections.

**Mistake 10: Transposing numbers**

Double-check:
- Social Security Numbers
- Dollar amounts
- Dates

A transposed digit in your SSN can delay processing for weeks.

### Timing Mistakes

**Mistake 11: Missing priority deadlines**

Some schools have **priority deadlines** for financial aid consideration.

Missing these might mean:
- Less aid available
- Loans instead of grants
- No aid at all

**Mistake 12: Not updating FAFSA with actual figures**

If you estimated tax information because you hadn't filed yet, remember to **update FAFSA** once you've filed your taxes.

### Strategic Mistakes

**Mistake 13: Not explaining special circumstances**

Both FAFSA and CSS Profile allow explanations of unusual circumstances.

**Use this space** to explain:
- Recent job loss
- Medical expenses
- Divorce
- Death in family
- Business losses

**Mistake 14: Not listing all schools you're considering**

List **all schools** you're seriously considering, even reach schools.

You can't receive aid from a school not listed on your FAFSA/CSS Profile.

**Mistake 15: Parents paying bills right before filing**

Paying off large bills immediately before filing reduces your **cash assets** but might raise questions.

Schools may ask about large asset reductions between years.

## Maximizing Your Financial Aid: Strategic Tips

Here's how to optimize your financial aid eligibility legally and ethically.

### Timing Strategies

**File early:**

Submit FAFSA **as soon as possible after October 1** when it opens.

Some aid is first-come, first-served.

Early filers get better aid packages at many schools.

**Complete financial transactions before December 31:**

Asset values are reported as of the date you file, but income from prior year is already set.

Strategic year-end planning can help:
- Pay down consumer debt (doesn't help aid calculation, but improves financial health)
- Delay bonuses or income to the following year (if possible)

### Asset Positioning

**Minimize student assets:**

Student assets are assessed at **20-25%** on FAFSA (20% of student assets expected to go to college costs).

Parent assets are assessed at **maximum 5.64%** (only 5.64% of parent assets expected to go to college costs).

**Strategies:**
- Spend student assets first on college expenses
- Keep college savings in parent-owned 529 plans, not student-owned accounts
- Pay off student car loans or credit cards before filing

**Understand which assets are counted:**

**NOT counted on FAFSA:**
- Primary residence
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, etc.)
- Life insurance cash value
- Annuities
- Small family businesses (fewer than 100 employees if you own >50%)

**Counted on FAFSA:**
- Cash, checking, savings
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Real estate other than primary home
- Trust funds
- UGMA/UTMA accounts

### Income Strategies

**Understand income impact:**

Parents' income is the **biggest factor** in financial aid calculations.

Student income has some protection:
- First $6,840 of student earnings not counted (for 2023-24)
- Above that, 50% of student income counts toward EFC

**Minimize reportable income when possible:**

**Maximize retirement contributions:** Money put in 401k reduces AGI

**Avoid capital gains:** Selling investments creates taxable income - delay if possible

**Minimize withdrawals from retirement accounts:** These count as income

**Flexible Spending Accounts:** Using FSAs for medical expenses reduces taxable income

### Special Circumstances Appeals

If your family's financial situation has changed since you filed:

**Job loss or income reduction**

**Major medical expenses**

**Divorce or separation**

**Death of a parent**

**Natural disaster**

**Contact the financial aid office** at each school and request a **professional judgment review**.

Provide documentation:
- Termination letter (job loss)
- Medical bills
- Divorce decree
- Death certificate

Schools can adjust your aid package based on special circumstances even after initial offers.

### CSS Profile Specific Strategies

**Home equity considerations:**

Some schools cap home equity consideration (e.g., 2x annual income).

Research each school's policy.

If you have high home equity but low income, target schools that cap home equity.

**Business/farm supplements:**

If you own a business or farm, complete these carefully.

Show all legitimate business expenses.

Explain if business value is illiquid (can't easily access to pay college costs).

**Explain income trends:**

If income has decreased recently, explain why in the special circumstances section.

If income increased unusually one year (e.g., one-time bonus), explain this is not recurring.

## After Submission: What Happens Next

### FAFSA Processing

**You'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR)** within 3-5 days by email (or 7-10 days by mail if no email provided).

**Review your SAR carefully:**
- Check all information for accuracy
- Note your **EFC or SAI** (Expected Family Contribution / Student Aid Index)
- Look for any errors or flags

**Your EFC/SAI:**

This number represents what the federal government thinks your family can afford to pay for college.

Lower EFC = More aid eligibility

EFC is NOT what you'll actually pay - each school creates its own aid package.

**Schools receive your FAFSA:**

All schools you listed will receive your information electronically.

They'll use it to create financial aid offers.

### CSS Profile Processing

**Confirmation email:**

You'll get immediate confirmation that your CSS Profile was submitted.

**Schools receive your information:**

Each school you listed receives your CSS Profile.

They'll use it along with FAFSA (for US students) to create institutional aid packages.

**No summary report:**

Unlike FAFSA, you don't get a summary report from CSS Profile.

**Print or save a copy** of your submission for your records.

### Verification Process

**25-30% of FAFSA filers are selected for verification.**

If selected, you'll need to provide additional documentation:

**IRS Tax Transcripts** (for you and your parents)

**Verification worksheet** (provided by your school)

**Proof of untaxed income**

**Proof of household size**

**Respond quickly** - verification can delay your aid offer.

Most schools can't finalize aid packages until verification is complete.

### Financial Aid Offers

**You'll receive financial aid offers** from each school you're admitted to.

**Offers typically arrive:**
- Early Decision/Early Action: December-January
- Regular Decision: March-April

**Each offer shows:**
- **Cost of Attendance** (total cost for one year)
- **Grants and scholarships** (free money, doesn't need to be repaid)
- **Work-study** (money you can earn through campus jobs)
- **Loans** (money you must repay with interest)
- **Expected Family Contribution** (what you're expected to pay)

**Compare offers carefully:**

Focus on **net price** (total cost minus grants/scholarships).

Understand the **composition** of each package (grants vs. loans).

Check **renewal requirements** (GPA minimums, continued need).

> **Compare Your Options:** Our [Graduate Admissions Calculator](/graduate-admissions-calculator) can help you plan for graduate school financial aid as well.

## Updating Your FAFSA or CSS Profile

Your financial situation or college plans might change. Here's how to update each form.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I file FAFSA and CSS Profile?

**FAFSA:** Opens October 1 each year for the following academic year. File as soon as possible after October 1. The federal deadline is June 30, but many states and schools have much earlier deadlines (often February or March). 

**CSS Profile:** Opens October 1 each year. Deadlines vary by school - check each college's financial aid website. Some schools have November deadlines for Early Decision/Early Action applicants and January/February deadlines for Regular Decision. Submit CSS Profile around the same time you submit your admission application.

**Best practice:** File both forms as early as possible. Some financial aid is awarded first-come, first-served, and early filers typically receive better packages.

### Can I file FAFSA if my parents haven't filed taxes yet?

Yes. You can file FAFSA using estimated tax information and update it later with actual figures once your parents file their taxes. The 2025-26 FAFSA uses 2023 tax information (two years prior), so most families will have already filed those taxes. If you do estimate, use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to update with actual figures once taxes are filed. This prevents errors and speeds up processing.

### Do I need to complete both FAFSA and CSS Profile?

It depends on your schools and citizenship status. **US citizens and permanent residents** applying to schools that require CSS Profile should complete both - FAFSA for federal aid and CSS Profile for institutional aid. **International students** (F-1 visa, no green card) are not eligible for federal aid and only complete CSS Profile if their schools require it. Check each school's financial aid website to see which forms they require.

### What if my parents are divorced or separated?

**For FAFSA:** Report information for the parent you lived with most during the past 12 months. If you lived equally with both, report the parent who provided more financial support. If that parent has remarried, you must include stepparent information. The non-custodial parent's information is not reported on FAFSA.

**For CSS Profile:** You report the custodial parent and stepparent (if remarried) on the main profile. Many schools also require a **Non-Custodial Parent CSS Profile** that your non-custodial parent completes separately. Check each school's requirements - some schools require it, others don't.

### What if my family's financial situation changed recently?

Contact the financial aid office at each school and request a **Professional Judgment Review** or **Special Circumstances Appeal**. Provide documentation of the change (job loss letter, medical bills, death certificate, divorce decree, etc.). Schools can adjust your aid package based on current circumstances even if your FAFSA/CSS Profile shows a different financial picture. This is especially important if a parent lost their job, you had major medical expenses, or experienced other significant financial changes.

### Can I add schools to my FAFSA after I submit it?

Yes. Log into studentaid.gov with your FSA ID, select "Make FAFSA Corrections," and add schools to your list. You can list up to 20 schools total on FAFSA. If you need to add more than 20, you'll need to remove some schools first (wait until you've received aid offers from them), then add new schools. For CSS Profile, you can add schools but must pay the fee ($16 per additional school) for each new school added after initial submission.

### How is home equity treated differently on FAFSA vs CSS Profile?

**FAFSA** does not ask about your primary residence at all - home equity is completely excluded from FAFSA calculations. **CSS Profile** asks for your home's current market value and mortgage amount, then calculates home equity. However, individual schools have different policies on how they treat home equity - some cap it at 1.2x income, 2x income, or 3x income, while others count it fully. Schools with generous financial aid policies often cap or limit home equity consideration, making them more favorable for families with high home equity but lower income.

### What's the difference between EFC and SAI?

**EFC (Expected Family Contribution)** was the term used on FAFSA until the 2024-25 academic year. **SAI (Student Aid Index)** is the new term as of the 2024-25 FAFSA. They serve the same purpose - indicating what your family is expected to contribute to college costs based on your financial information. The calculation formula changed slightly, but the concept is the same. Lower SAI/EFC means higher aid eligibility. Note that SAI/EFC is NOT what you'll actually pay - each school creates its own financial aid package based on this number plus their own policies and available funds.

### How do I report my parents' small business on financial aid forms?

**On FAFSA:** Small businesses with fewer than 100 employees that you (and/or your spouse) control more than 50% of are NOT reported as assets. If the business has 100+ employees, you report the net worth (value minus debt). 

**On CSS Profile:** You must report all business ownership regardless of size. CSS Profile has detailed Business/Farm Supplement forms that ask about business assets, debts, number of employees, revenue, and expenses. Be thorough and accurate - the net value after legitimate business debts and operating needs is what matters. If your business value is mostly tied up in equipment or inventory (not liquid cash), explain this in special circumstances.

### Will applying for financial aid hurt my admission chances?

At **need-blind schools** (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, and most large public universities), applying for financial aid has absolutely zero effect on admission decisions. At **need-aware schools**, applying for financial aid may have some impact on admission chances, particularly for borderline candidates. However, if you need aid to attend college, you should apply for it regardless - there's no point getting admitted to a school you can't afford. Strong candidates still have excellent admission chances at need-aware schools even when applying for aid. Check each school's policy - most are upfront about being need-blind or need-aware.

### Can I negotiate my financial aid package?

Yes, many schools will reconsider financial aid packages if you have legitimate reasons. You can request a **Professional Judgment Review** if your financial circumstances changed since filing FAFSA/CSS Profile. You can also ask schools to match or beat competing offers from peer institutions - this works best when comparing offers from schools of similar caliber and selectivity. Always be professional and respectful when requesting reconsideration, provide documentation of any changed circumstances or competing offers, and explain why attending their school is your preference if finances can work out.

### What documents do I need to keep for verification?

If you're selected for verification (about 25-30% of FAFSA filers), you'll need: **IRS Tax Transcripts** (not tax returns - schools want official transcripts from the IRS), verification worksheet provided by your school, W-2 forms, proof of untaxed income (child support, veterans benefits, etc.), proof of household size and family members in college, and identity verification (Social Security card, driver's license). Even if not selected for verification, keep all these documents in case the school requests them. Respond quickly to verification requests - your aid package cannot be finalized until verification is complete.

### How do scholarships affect my financial aid package?

**External scholarships** (from outside organizations) must be reported to your college's financial aid office. How they affect your package depends on the school's policy. Typically, scholarships first reduce the **loan and work-study** portions of your aid package, which benefits you by reducing debt and work requirements. Once loans and work-study are eliminated, additional scholarships may start reducing **grant aid** dollar-for-dollar, meaning you don't gain additional benefit. Some schools are more generous and let you keep more scholarship money. Always report scholarships as required - failing to report can result in loss of aid and even disciplinary action.

### As an international student, how do I convert my country's currency for CSS Profile?

Use the **current exchange rate** on the date you complete CSS Profile. Document which exchange rate you used and the date (write it down or screenshot it for your records). Convert all income and assets from your home currency to US dollars using this rate. For example, if your parent earns ₹3,000,000 annually in India and the exchange rate is ₹83 per dollar, you would report approximately $36,145 USD annual income. In the special circumstances section, explain if your currency has weakened significantly recently, as this affects your family's actual purchasing power. Some financial aid offices are familiar with common currency conversions for countries with many applicants.

### What if I made a mistake on FAFSA or CSS Profile after submitting?

**For FAFSA:** Log in to studentaid.gov with your FSA ID and select "Make FAFSA Corrections." Correct any errors and resubmit. You'll receive an updated SAR (Student Aid Report) showing the corrections. Schools you listed will receive the updated information automatically.

**For CSS Profile:** Log in to your College Board account and create a correction profile. Make your changes and submit to schools. However, schools that already received your original CSS Profile won't automatically get updates - you must contact each school's financial aid office directly to inform them of corrections. For significant errors, call the financial aid office immediately rather than waiting for the correction process.
